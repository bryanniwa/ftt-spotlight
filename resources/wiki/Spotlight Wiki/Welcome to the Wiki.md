As part of our commitment to help staff and students get smarter together, we're introducing the Spotlight Wiki.

Spotlight Wiki is a place where staff can read about new features within Spotlight, as well as how-to guides for getting things done.

We'll keep you posted as we add more content to the Wiki!
